# Hunter-mania
 In this project, I developed an interactive browser-based game using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS. The game, titled "Hunter vs. Time Traveler," is a dynamic platformer where two characters, a hunter and a time traveler, navigate through obstacles and attempt to catch each other.
